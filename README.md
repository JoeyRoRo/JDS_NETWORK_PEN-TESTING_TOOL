## JDS NETWORK PEN-TESTING TOOL ##
##################################

Program was written in and intented for use with python 2.7. The latest version is v1.1 and was last updated on 8 July 2015.

This program is used to listen to or capture network traffic. This program is intended for personal use, or use on your own network and devices. Please refer to all state, federal, and national laws before conducting any network pen-testing.

With this program it is possible to capture network traffic on Wi-Fi, or cabled networks. You must have a network interface that is capable of going into monitor mode (aka permisquous mode). 

To start the program please execute the "myapp.py" file in the root of the program folder.

The program uses a variety of other programs that are all built into Kali Linux. The program mainly uses the 'Aircrack suite'. But here are a list of dependencies/commands that must be capable of running on your Kali linux OS in order for all of the program to work...

ifconfig
clear
macchanger
airodump-ng
airmon-ng
wash
bully
arpspoof
arp-scan
tcpdump
ettercap

...When ever the program executes a command in a seperate window, it is opening in order for you to see information before making choices, or to execute the final command and let it run in a seperate window. In order to break these command please press "Ctrl" + "C". 

Thanks goes out to Kevin for making the console menu program, which was the shell for this program. Also Thanks goes out to the makers of Kali, and all the above stated programs in order for this program to work. 

If there are any questions or suggestions regarding htis program please feel free to contact me at joejoejoey13@gmail.com.
